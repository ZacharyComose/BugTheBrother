# BugTheBrother
It's a robot to absolutely annoy the crud out of my brother. Hoping for multiple iterations. 
I'm still working on the full scope of things but general gameplan is the following:
  1. Have a bunch of little buzzers in balls that spin and bounce and make a lot of noise
  2. These will be shot by a remote controlled raspberry pi robot on command from the ground station
  3. The ground station will also be a raspberry pi
  4. I'm pretty sure I'm going to use some radios in there somewhere as well along with maybe some other sensors to transmit data


All of this is really just me building some skills. Plus I've never used git much before so I'm looking for some projects.
